I am a B.Eng student at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada. My interests are in: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Signals Processing, and Software Engineering. My goal is to do research in those fields here at Ryerson University! 

In my spare time, I like to read books on philosophy and go running.
