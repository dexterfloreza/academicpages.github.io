Welcome to my webpage! My name is Dexter Ryan Floreza and I am a second-year computer engineering undergraduate student at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada. 
You can call me "Dexter" for short.

My research interests are in artificial intelligence, machine learning, signals processing, and software engineering. I hope to someday work in innovative research labs here at this university!

I enjoy reading books on philosophy and science fiction. When it comes to physical fitness, I enjoy running, weightlifting, and playing basketball. In my free time, I enjoy watching Toronto Raptors basketball games. 

As time goes by, I'll be continuously making improvements to this page and updating you all with more content.

Enjoy!

Dexter Floreza
